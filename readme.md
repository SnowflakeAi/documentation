Snowflake Guide
===============

This guide will walk you through how to get started using Snowflake, if you are looking for how to use the API then checkout the [Developer API](/api.html).

### First step

Your data is the foundation of how Snowflake works, so the very first step is to describe your data in the Snowflake UI. Navigate to the schema editor and start adding the different properties. In Snowflake you can describe very complex data where you can have objects that contain lists that contain other lists. So you should be able to duplicate your internal data structure. This means that you keep it recognisable and more important you keep all the insights inside the data which later can be used when making segments, automations and inside the template editor.
